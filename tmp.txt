Redshift is a measure of how much the wavelength of light from a galaxy has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. It provides crucial information on the galaxy's velocity and distance and can be analyzed through multiple perspectives. Specifically, the<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>utilizes celestial image data to obtain observational information such as morphology and luminosity, providing an initial estimate of distance. The Ã directly calculates the redshift value through the displacement of spectral lines. The þ offers spatial coordinates in Euclidean space, aiding in the calculation of the celestial object's position and distance. The æ describes more complex cosmic structures, providing additional geometric context. The ø utilizes spherical geometry information to understand the object's position in a spherical coordinate system, aiding in distance determination. By integrating the information from these tokens, we derive the redshift value of the celestial object.<|im_end|>
